recitation-bot
==============

Pronounced as in "recitation" (reh-sih-tay-shun) or "re-citation" (ree-sigh-tay-shun).

To create clear signals of "open access"ness in Wikipedia references, when triggered, this [MediaWiki](https://mediawiki.org/) bot uploads permissible cited content to relevant Wikimedia projects and updates corresponding citations on Wikipedia. Intended to replace citation-bot, with a focus on DOIs and Open Access scholarly literature.
